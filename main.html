    <p><strong>Main articles:</strong> History of blogging and online diary</p>
    <p>An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted <br> wirelessly in real-time
        from a
        wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, <br> 1995 The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger[13]
        on
        December 17, 1997. The <br> short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word <br>
        weblog into
        the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or <br>May 1999.[14][15][16] Shortly
        thereafter,
        Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as <br> both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one''s weblog
        or to
        post to one''s <br> weblog") and devised the term "blogger" <br> in connection with Pyra Labs'' Blogger product,
        leading
        to the popularization of the terms.[17]</p>
